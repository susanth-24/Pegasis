# Object detection with depth estimation
This project helps us in predicting distances of the specified objects in the image from the camera.
## Depth Estimation
This Project uses encoder decoder model for predicting the depth map of the image. The model is trained on NYU V2 dataset which has depth images as ground truth.
The model is still under training.
The following are the results from training the model for 18 epoches
